# Data Preprocessing Tool

The **Data Preprocessing Tool** is a Python application built using the PyQt5 library that facilitates data loading, preprocessing, and command execution. This tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with tabs for different functionalities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required libraries: pandas, PyQt5

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas PyQt5
## Usage
Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
bash
Copy code
**python DataProTool.py**
The tool's GUI will open, showing three tabs:

Load Data: Load data from various file formats such as CSV, Excel, and text files.
Load and Pandas Status: View the status of Pandas readiness and file loading.
Terminal: Enter and execute Python commands in a terminal-like environment.
Follow the instructions within each tab to perform the desired operations.

## Features
Load Data Tab: Allows you to load and preprocess data from CSV, Excel, or text files. Once data is loaded, it provides status updates on Pandas readiness and file loading.

Pandas Ready Tab: Displays the status of Pandas readiness and file loading. It shows whether Pandas is ready to process data and whether a file has been successfully loaded.

Terminal Tab: Provides a text editor where you can enter Python commands. You can execute these commands on the loaded data when available.

## Customization
You can customize the tool by extending its functionality or enhancing the user interface. The provided code offers a basic foundation for data preprocessing and command execution. Depending on your needs, you can further develop the tool to include additional features or improve the user experience.

## Note
The provided code serves as a starting point for creating a data preprocessing tool using PyQt5. You can modify and expand the code to suit your specific requirements.

Ensure that you handle edge cases appropriately when loading data or executing commands. Add proper error handling to enhance the reliability of the tool.
