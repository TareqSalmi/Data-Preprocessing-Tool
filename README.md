# Data Preprocessing Tool

The **Data Preprocessing Tool** is a Python application designed using the PyQt5 library. This tool offers a graphical user interface for loading and preprocessing various types of data files, displaying the status of Pandas readiness, and providing a terminal interface for executing commands on the loaded data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- PyQt5 library installed. You can install it using the following command:

**pip install PyQt5**

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

**python dataprotool.py**

Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the script containing the provided code.

2. The Data Preprocessing Tool application window will open.

3. **Load Data Tab**: Click the "Load Data to Tool" button to select a data file (CSV, Excel, or Text) for loading and preprocessing.

4. **Pandas Status Tab**: This tab displays the Pandas readiness status ("Pandas Ready: Yes" or "Pandas Ready: No Data") and the file loaded status ("File Loaded: Yes" or "File Loaded: No"). These statuses are updated based on your actions.

5. **Terminal Tab**: You can input commands in the terminal text box and click the "Execute" button to execute those commands on the loaded data. Ensure that data has been loaded before attempting to execute commands.

## Features

- **Load Data Tab**: Allows you to select and load CSV, Excel, or Text files for data preprocessing.
- **Pandas Status Tab**: Displays the Pandas readiness status and the file loaded status.
- **Terminal Tab**: Provides a terminal interface to execute custom commands on the loaded data.

## Customization

- You can further enhance and customize this tool by extending the code. For instance, you can add more preprocessing functionalities, integrate data visualization, or improve error handling.

## Note

- The provided code serves as a starting point for building a data preprocessing tool using PyQt5. Modify the code to suit your specific requirements.

- This tool is intended for basic data preprocessing tasks. For more advanced data processing, consider using specialized libraries and tools.
